Before you met, you were both living "La Vie Bohème".
The daily grind, pay the "Rent", didn't matter if it was Binghamton or "Santa Fe".

But when Heather saw Adam getting ready to "Tune Up" his sax, she just couldn't wait for him to leave that first "Voice Mail".

It wasn't always easy. 
You may have asked yourselves "Will I?" 
At times it may have even felt like you were out "On the Street". 
But when Heather said "Take Me or Leave Me", "Light My Candle", "You'll See"! 
Those words hit Adam like "One Song Glory". It was suddenly clear. These are the "Seasons of Love".

Heather, Adam, when you look at each other, I can hear what you're thinking.
"We're Okay". "I'll Cover You". "Without You" I am lost. "I Should Tell You", "What You Own" is my whole heart.
"Another Day" without you would land me on "Life Support".

When I look at "Your Eyes" I think I know your secret. It's the small things every day that keep your love in bloom. 
A little eye "Contact". The quick "Goodbye Love" before work in the morning, the "You Okay Honey?" at dinner.

"Today 4 U" your loved ones are "Out Tonight" to dance a "Tango: Maureen".
A grand "Finale" to the previous chapter, and a fresh start for the next.

I am just "Over the Moon". It's "Christmas Bells" on "Halloween". "Happy New Year"!

From THE PROPHET By Kahlil Gibran

You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.

You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.

Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.

But let there be spaces in your togetherness,

And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.

Love one another, but make not a bond of love:

Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.

Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.

Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. 

Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,

Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.

Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.

For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.

And stand together yet not too near together:

For the pillars of the temple stand apart,

And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.
